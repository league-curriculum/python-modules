Function Demo
Functions allow code to be executed without copying and pasting the same code
in multiple places. Using functions means writing less code (and therefore
potentially less mistakes) and makes the code more maintainable (if there
is an error it only has to be fixed in the function and not in each place
where the code is duplicated).

# Function basics
# All functions have the following format:
#
# def <function name>(<input_variable_1>, <input_variable_2>):
#
#   - 'def' tells the computer the following code is the start of a function
#     definition
#   - <function name> is the name of the function. This name is used to
#     execute the code in the function, also know as calling the function.
#   - <input_variable_1> is an input variable. They are optional. If there is
#     more than 1 input variable, they're separated by commas.
#   - '()' open and close parenthesis are always right after the function name
#     if there are any input variables they go between the parenthesis
#   - ':" the colon is always at the end, just like for, if, elif, and else
def function_1(var1, var2):
    # Only the indented lines of code are executed. Lines that aren't indented
    # do not get executed when the function is called.
    print('You called function_1 with var1=' + str(var1) + ' and var2=' + str(var2))


def function_2(var1, var2, var3):
    print('You called function_2 with var1=' + str(var1) + ', var2=' + str(var2) + ', var3=' + str(var3))


# Any one of the input variables can have default values. These values are
# applied when the function is called without a value for the input variable.
# Once a default value is set for an input variable all other input variables
# that come afterwards must also have default values.
def function_3(var1, var2, var3='default value'):
    print('You called function_3 with var1=' + str(var1) + ', var2=' + str(var2) + ', var3=' + str(var3))


# A function can return a value with the return keyword. When return is used,
# the function ends immediately and no further lines of code are executed. The
# returned value can be saved in a variable when the function is called:
# return_var = function_4(10)
def function_4(var1):
    print('You called function_4 with var1=' +str(var1))
    return var1 * var1 * var1

    # Code after return is not executed
    print('This line is not executed')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Code starts here!

    # To use a function write the function's name and put the same number of
    # inputs listed in the function definition. The inputs can either be a
    # value (1, 20.5, "text") or a variable.
    text_variable = 'hello'
    function_1(1, text_variable)

    # Functions can also be called using the input variable from the function
    # definition. This makes the function call more descriptive.
    function_2(var1=1, var2=2, var3=3)

    # It's possible to only label some of the inputs of a function call, but
    # once an input variable is labeled all the inputs that come after must
    # also be labeled. For example:
    #function_2(7, var2=8, var3=9)   # works
    #function_2(var1=4, var2=5, 6)   # doesn't work

    # Calling function_3 with 2 input variables (3rd takes the default value)
    function_3('one', 'two')

    # Calling function_3 with 3 input variables
    function_3('one', 'two', 'three')

    return_var = function_4(10)
    print('Value returned by function_4 is: ' + str(return_var))
